# VESPA-App

The VESPA-App is mobile/web-responsive interface to improve the users experience on exploring planetary data. It is meant to be an extension, simplified version of the main VESPA query portal at 'http://vespa.obspm.fr'.

the VESPA-App provides a higher level, less technical interface to explore the data in those services by offering the data products (images, footprints, spectra) at first hand, and _then_ linking the user to the services through the VESPA portal.

In other words, the goal of the VESPA-App is to make VESPA data search more accessible.
And _any_ suggestion to help us achieve this goal is much welcome and may be done through the App [GitHub issues].
Main goals are:
