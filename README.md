# VESPA-App

VESPA Mapping App is a project within [VESPA] to build a mobile app to search, discover mapping data from the VESPA VO.

A web-based interface already exists but it is neither user-friendly nor allows for map-based query and visualisation.
The overall objective is to make VESPA data search more accessible.
Main goals are:
* Increase of VESPA VO use (overall impact of EPN VESPA)
* Catch (engage) new non-traditional science users to use both app & analysis tools
* Make data more familiar to student/outreach users

## Usability

As of version `0.1-alpha` the app has the main components in place, but a good
amount of mechanics has yet to be implemented.
The technical user is referred to check the [wiki] pages for a detailed
description of the App's structure, development status and data/work flow.
